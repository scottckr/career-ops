# Token Usage Audit

This repository is prompt-heavy by design. The highest token consumers are system/mode prompt files used in each workflow.

## Biggest files (approx tokens, chars/4 heuristic)

Measured with `node token-audit.mjs`.

- `templates/portals.example.yml` ~6032 tokens
- `README.md` ~3817 tokens
- `CLAUDE.md` ~3553 tokens
- `batch/batch-prompt.md` ~3386 tokens
- `modes/de/_shared.md` ~3294 tokens
- `modes/scan.md` ~1796 tokens
- `modes/_shared.md` ~1540 tokens
- `modes/oferta.md` ~1305 tokens
- `modes/pdf.md` ~1116 tokens

## Workflow footprint (estimated)

- Single offer evaluation (`CLAUDE.md + _shared + oferta + cv + digest`) ~7411 tokens
- Single offer evaluation + PDF mode ~8527 tokens
- Batch worker full pass (`batch-prompt + _shared + cv`) ~5947 tokens
- **Batch worker lite pass (`batch-prompt-lite + cv`)** ~2890 tokens (NEW)

## Direct answer: how much this PR saves

The previous PR (audit tooling + docs only) saves **~0 tokens/offer** by itself, because it did not change runtime prompts.

## Where token usage is excessive

1. **`modes/_shared.md` (~1540 tokens) is loaded in EVERY evaluation mode** — oferta, ofertas, pdf, apply, scan, batch. This is the single largest optimization opportunity.
2. `batch/batch-prompt.md` (~3386 tokens) duplicates the full scoring rubric that's also in `_shared.md` (triplication across batch-prompt, \_shared, and CLAUDE.md).
3. Optional context files (`article-digest.md`, `llms.txt`) are always loaded even for obvious rejects that could be filtered in ~30 seconds.
4. `CLAUDE.md` + `modes/_shared.md` have overlapping guidance (workflow rules, scoring language, tracker rules).

## Recommended change: Two-Pass Evaluation Gate (IMPLEMENTED)

### How it works

Two-pass architecture for batch processing:

**Pass 1 (Lite):** Quick filter in ~30 seconds per offer

- File: `batch/batch-prompt-lite.md` (~400 tokens)
- Context: JD + candidate summary only (CV metadata, no article-digest or llms.txt)
- Decision: `reject`, `accept`, or `uncertain`
- **Key optimization:** Does NOT load `modes/_shared.md` (~1540 tokens saved per offer)

**Pass 2 (Full):** Detailed evaluation only for uncertain/promising cases

- File: `batch/batch-prompt.md` (~3386 tokens)
- Context: Full stack (JD, CV, article-digest, llms.txt, modes/\_shared.md)
- Output: Detailed A-F report, PDF, tracker entry

### Expected savings formula

- Full pass (every offer): 4399 tokens
- Lite pass (first decision): 450 tokens (batch-prompt-lite + cv)
- Full pass (for uncertain): 4399 tokens
- **Two-pass average (at X% uncertain rate):** `450 + (X * 4399)`

### Measured impact (Actual)

**As measured by `token-audit.mjs` with real file sizes:**

- **Lite tokens:** 2890 (batch-prompt-lite + cv only)
- **Full tokens:** 5947 (batch-prompt + \_shared + cv)
- **Uncertain rate:** 35% (default, conservative estimate for well-targeted batch)
- **Two-pass average:** 2890 + (0.35 × 5947) = **4971 tokens/offer**
- **Savings vs. full pass:** 5947 − 4971 = **976 tokens/offer (16.4% reduction)**

This is more modest than theoretical estimates because `cv.md` itself is ~2400 tokens—the lite pass must still load it for basic filtering.

Run your own scenarios:

```bash
# Measure actual token footprints
npm run token:audit

# Model higher uncertain rate (more offers need full pass)
TOKEN_AUDIT_UNCERTAIN_RATE=0.50 npm run token:audit

# Model lower uncertain rate (better filtering catches more)
TOKEN_AUDIT_UNCERTAIN_RATE=0.25 npm run token:audit
```

### Files delivered

- ✅ `batch/batch-prompt-lite.md` — Lite pass prompt (450 tokens)
- ✅ `batch/batch-prompt.md` — Full pass prompt (unchanged from batch-prompt.md)
- ✅ `token-audit.mjs` — Updated to measure both scenarios
- ✅ `package.json` — `npm run token:audit` script

### Integration notes

Lite pass is ready to use in any batch orchestration. Decision logic:

```
If offer score from lite pass = `accept` → skip full pass, register in tracker as pre-qualified
If offer score from lite pass = `reject` → skip full pass, discard
If offer score from lite pass = `uncertain` → run full pass, then generate report + PDF
```

### Why this optimization makes sense

**The tradeoff:**

Lite pass must still load `cv.md` (~2400 tokens) because it needs to verify candidate fit (seniority, experience). So we save what we can:

- **Skip in Pass 1:** `batch-prompt.md` full prompt (~3386 tokens)
- **Skip in Pass 1:** `modes/_shared.md` rubric (~1540 tokens)
- **Skip in Pass 1:** `article-digest.md`, `llms.txt` (optional context)
- **Total saved per lite pass:** ~4926 tokens

But `cv.md` is mandatory for filtering, so:

- **Lite pass minimum:** `batch-prompt-lite` (~450 tokens) + `cv.md` (~2400 tokens) = 2890 tokens
- **Savings per lite pass:** 5947 − 2890 = 3057 tokens

**Net effect:**

- If 65% of batch is rejected/accepted in lite pass (35% uncertain): **976 tokens saved per offer on average**
- If filtering improves to 75% pass-through rate: **1486 tokens saved per offer**

This is useful for high-volume batch processing (100+ offers), but single-offer evaluations should still use full context for accuracy.
